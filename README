PENNANT is an unstructured mesh physics mini-app designed for advanced
architecture research.  It contains mesh data structures and a few
physics algorithms adapted from the LANL rad-hydro code FLAG, and gives
a sample of the typical memory access patterns of FLAG.

Further documentation can be found in the 'doc' directory of the
PENNANT distribution.

This version of PENNANT was updated in January of 2018 to use 
the most recent Legion interface and to prepare it for experimentation
with dynamic control replication. This process included adding a 
dynamic mesh generation routine for rectangular and pie meshes
using Legion dependent partitioning primitives.
