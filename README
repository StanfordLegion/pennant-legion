PENNANT is an unstructured mesh physics mini-app designed for advanced
architecture research.  It contains mesh data structures and a few
physics algorithms adapted from the LANL rad-hydro code FLAG, and gives
a sample of the typical memory access patterns of FLAG.

Further documentation can be found in the 'doc' directory of the
PENNANT distribution.
